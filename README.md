# 105daysofX
Inspired to start a challenge.
Is it true that it takes 21 days to build a habit?<br />
Doesn't matter how long it takes. Do what you like and keep moving forward.<br />

There are some codes that was used for practice in my study folders so <br/> 
I'll probably look through them and upload it little by little. <br />
Who knows if I actually keep up right?

It might be a random mixture of things...

Anyways, 105days because my beloved great-grandmother (Haru-Banchang) turned
ONE HUNDERED AND FIVE Years old this year so it's a good number.
Haven't met her since March because of covid and I really miss her.
Hopefully we will be able to meet by the time this challenge ends.

Oh goshhh...
Got a little too busy with studying with the books/cousera/udemy and also teaching~~~ 
Hope I can continue again next time. Will be taking a break for abit!
