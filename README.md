# 105daysofX
Inspired to start a challenge.
Is it true 21 days make a habit?
Doesn't matter. Do what you like and keep moving forward.

There are some codes that was used for practice in my study folders so I'll 
probably look through them and upload it little by little.
Who knows if I actually keep up right?

It might be a random mixture of things...

Anyways, 105days because my beloved great-grandmother (Haru-Banchang) turned
ONE HUNDERED AND FIVE Years old this year so it's a good number.
Haven't met her since March because of covid and I really miss her.
Hopefully we will be able to meet by the time this challenge ends.
